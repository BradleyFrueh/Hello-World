# Hello-Github
Just made my first edit on my first repository on github. Lets see what this coding thing is all about!

A little about me. I am a Public Health student at Emory University specializing in Epidemiology, the study of the distribution and determinates of health and disease in a population. My first introduction to computer programming was in a class I took at Emory that taught statistical programming in SAS and R studio. Since that class I have become increasingly interested in building things with code. I've found myself watching more videos than actually coding so I think its about time I make a github account. I'm still learning but we all have to start somewhere.
